### Milestone 1 Quiz

1. The purpose of `git commit` is to save changes in incremental steps.
2. When you push to GitHub, your changes get stored in the remote repository.
3. We should commit multiple times instead of once at the end to be able to get back to a previous working version and to have an easier time reviewing code.
4. A local repository is stored on your device, while a remote repository is stored on a server, like GitHub.

### Milestone 2 Quiz

1. `display: flex` turns an element into a flex container, allowing children to be aligned and spaced easily.
2. A media query is a CSS rule that applies styles conditionally.
3. Responsive design should be handled in CSS, not JS, to keep logic from styling.
4. If a media query is placed before base styles, it may get overridden by the base styles written after it.

### Milestone 3 Quiz

1. In Vue, `data` stores reactive state, while `computed` derives reactive values based on data and updates automatically.
2. We should not manipulate the DOM manually in Vue because Vue uses a virtual DOM and reactive updates. Editing it manually might introduce bugs.
3. `v-html` renders raw HTML inside an element.
4. We must strip HTML before counting characters to only count visible text--not HTML tags.
